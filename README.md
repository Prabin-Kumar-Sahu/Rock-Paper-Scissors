# Rock-Paper-Scissors

The Rock Paper Scissors project built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is a fun and interactive game that allows users to play against the computer. The game is built using modern web development technologies, making it easy to play and visually engaging.

The game interface is created using HTML and styled using CSS. The buttons for selecting rock, paper, or scissors are styled to give them a 3D effect, making them look like actual buttons. The game score and result are displayed using HTML, giving the user a clear understanding of the current state of the game.

The game logic is implemented using JavaScript. When a user selects their move, the JavaScript code generates a random move for the computer and compares the two moves to determine the winner. The game score is updated accordingly and displayed on the game interface.
